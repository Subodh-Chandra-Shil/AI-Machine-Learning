**Features**: All the available input data those are independent.  
**Label**: What we have to predict or guess. Labels are dependent on the features data.

> **Q1**: Can we have multiple numbers of features and labels?

1. **Supervised Learning**
   - **Classification**: Which class or category the data represents. Classify the data label.
     - Binary classification: Only contains two categories.
     - Multiclass classification: Contains more than two categories.
   - **Regression**: What to predict, guess or forecast based previously trained features.

2. **Unsupervised Learning**: No labels are provided, the algorithm divide dataset into multiple groups or clusters based on similarity of features. So, within a cluster the data is share similar traits whereas between clusters there are abundance of differentiable traits. 

3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Reinforce to do a task by providing rewards if it continues to do the task in the correct way.
