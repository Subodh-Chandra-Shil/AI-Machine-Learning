**Features**: All the available input data those are independent.  
**Label**: What we have to predict or guess. Labels are dependent on the features data.

> **Q1**: Can we have multiple numbers of features and labels?

**Unsupervised learning**: No labels are provided, the algorithm divide dataset into multiple groups or clusters based on similarity of features. So, within a cluster the data is share similar traits whereas between clusters there are abundance of differentiable traits.
