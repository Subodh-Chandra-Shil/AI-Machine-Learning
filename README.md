## **```AI```**
- We want machines to think like humans and take decision. 
- Machine is more reliable for if continuous and effecient work process.
- Machines are not biased. 
- With AI, machines are given or trained to mimic some feature of human nature such as prediction or decision.
- Training data -> ML Algorithm -> Model 
- ML engineering is more simply using ML algorithms to put in a box and creating AI model that can solve a problem like humans do in real life. 

> Machine learning is a technique to implement AI that can be learn from the data by themselves without being explicitly programmed.

- Teach machine to evaluate result on the basis of data. 

- Machine learning is a AI domain

**Classic ML**: 

**Artificial Neural Network**: 

- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Reinforcement learning 

### Supervised learning 
Algorithm learns from labelled data. 

### Unsupervised learning 
Learns from unlabelled data.
