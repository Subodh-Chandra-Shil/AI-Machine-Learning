## **```AI```**
- We want machines to think like humans and take decision. 
- Machine is more reliable for if continuous and effecient work process.
- Machines are not biased. 
- With AI, machines are given or trained to mimic some feature of human nature such as prediction or decision.
- Training data -> ML Algorithm -> Model 
- ML engineering is more simply using ML algorithms to put in a box and creating AI model that can solve a problem like humans do in real life. 

## **```ML```**

> Machine learning is a technique to implement AI that can be learn from the data by themselves without being explicitly programmed.

- Teach machine to evaluate result on the basis of data. 

- Machine learning is a AI domain

**Classic ML**: 

**Artificial Neural Network**: 

- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Reinforcement learning 

### Supervised learning 
Algorithm learns from labelled data. 
- Regression: Getting continous output against to the given input.
- Classfication

### Unsupervised learning 
Learns from unlabelled data. 
- Clustering: Clustering means categorize similar dataset in different individual groups.
- Association: Find relationship between various cluster data groups. 

> In simple term, in supervised learning ML models are provided both input and output of dataset. Whereas, in unsupervised learning it will guess or predict output using existing supervised test data. 

## Deep learning
Utilizes ```artificial neural network``` that replicates actual human brain to make decision. 

## **Tensors**
Tensor is a data structure or container similar to a n-D array, that stores number or other types. 

### 0D Tensor or Scaler
Any single number is a scaler.

# NumPy
This package provide native array implementation.
